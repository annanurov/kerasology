# kerasology"

Kerasology is a collection of Deep Learning samples implemented with tf.Keras and other libraries. 
Most programming may be converted to Keras (independent of Tensorflow) with enough ambition.

Files are presented in jupyter notebook format.

Requirements: Python 3, tensorflow, and others (please see imports in each notebook).

Similar code is implemented on https://www.kaggle.com/bayram5000/code.
Kaggle notebooks are not connected to github and are updated more often.
